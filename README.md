The project Hate Speech / Toxic Comment Detection aims at:

Removing any textual material containing hate or toxicity.
The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop  expressing themselves.
Toxic comments spread negativity, racial harassment and depression.

Problem Description-

Given any text or paragraph containing a few lines in natural language, the objective  is to classify it as belonging to one or more of the following categories:  clean, obscene, threatening, insulting, toxic, severely toxic and identity hate.


Abstract:

With the push towards the decline in data rates and growth of telecommunication networks in the last few years, there has been a huge spike in the number of internet users. Penetration of high bandwidth connection into the remotest part of the world has enabled quite a few users to come up online and express their opinions and thoughts. However, the another side of coin is that it has lead to increase in instances of hate speech and bullying which not only holds back certain users from opening up freely with ingenious ideas but also spreads negativity, depression, communal/racial hatred and at times can trigger riots. So it becomes imperative for social media ventures to ensure that their platform is free from toxicity to encourage free flow of information and opinions.
